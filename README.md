## Welcome to my GitHub page!

### Overview
Hi there! I'm Connor, a geoscientist with a PhD in Geology and Earth Sciences. I started learning about R and Python during my PhD, and have since been learning how to code and ultimately visualise and work with geoscience-based data. This repository has some, hopefully useful, examples of code and projects I work on publicly in my spare time.

### Current Projects
- Python for Geoscience (just started!)
