## Welcome to my GitHub page!

### Overview
Hi there! I'm Connor, a geoscientist with a PhD in Geology and Earth Sciences. I started learning about R and Python during my PhD, and have since been learning how to code and ultimately visualise and work with geoscience-based data. This repository is a work in progress of my current day-to-day scripts and has some, hopefully useful, examples of code and projects I work on publicly in my spare time.

### Current Projects
- [Python for Geoscience](https://github.com/geo-cjd/Python-for-Geoscience) - Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebooks for working with, analysing and visualising Geoscience data.
- [Geoscience in Dash](https://github.com/geo-cjd/Geoscience-in-Dash) - Ongoing development of Plotly-Dash based apps for working with Geoscience data in an interactive format.
